# Roomly App Feature Roadmap

This directory contains the feature development roadmap for the Roomly property management application. Each markdown file outlines a specific feature with its associated tickets, tasks, and acceptance criteria.

## MVP Development Path

The features are ordered by implementation priority:

1. [Authentication Setup](./01-authentication-setup.md)
2. [Property Management Basics](./02-property-management-basics.md)
3. [Tenant Dashboard](./03-tenant-dashboard.md)
4. [Basic Messaging](./04-basic-messaging.md)
5. [Basic Rent Payments](./05-basic-rent-payments.md)
6. [Maintenance Requests](./06-maintenance-requests.md)
7. [User Profiles](./07-user-profiles.md)
8. [Property Documents](./08-property-documents.md)
9. [Property Announcements](./09-property-announcements.md)

## Feature Structure

Each feature file follows this structure:

- **Overview**: A brief description of the feature
- **Tickets**: Individual development tasks needed to complete the feature
  - **Description**: What the ticket aims to accomplish
  - **Tasks**: Specific implementation steps
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: Requirements that must be met
  - **Testing**: How to verify the implementation
  - **Definition of Done**: Clear criteria for ticket completion

## Development Workflow

1. Start with the first feature (Authentication Setup)
2. Complete all tickets within that feature
3. Proceed to the next feature once all tickets in the current feature are completed
4. Ensure each feature is fully functional before moving on

This incremental approach ensures we always have a working application with gradually expanding functionality.
